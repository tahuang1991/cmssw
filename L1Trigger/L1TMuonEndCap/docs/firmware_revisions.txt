before adding CSCID=1 BC0 for all links

46650 2016-07-29
added CSCID=1 BC0 for all links

46723 2016-08-10
reworked best_tracks to sort current and delayed tracks, 
cancel ghosts across BXs, and delay tracks for second-earliest LCT timing. 
Ph_pattern reports patterns on first-earliest LCT, as before

46731 2016-08-11
added programmable th_window, fixed enb inputs on spy memory delay memories

46773 2016-08-16
best_tracks reworked to use each track on second-earliest LCT,
cancel ghosts across 3 BX.
Tested in simulator extensively

46782 2016-08-17
small mistake in best_tracks fixed (now counts zeros in all 36 
comparisons results). Added debugging for links that go out of sync

46799 2016-08-19
reworked IDLE detection to detect long train of IDLEs, not a single
symbol. Single IDLE happens often in garbage data

46827 2016-08-24
rate counters made 26-bit wide, 1 sec integration time
added user-programmable AF delays, af_enable=0 now applies these delays

46841 2016-08-26
fixed bug in track rate counters when it was taking only track 2 for 
all rates

47109 2016-09-19
before ph_hit logic rework and find_segment full-precision diff sort

47114 2016-09-19
prim_conv units reworked to provide close match between full and pattern
lower precision phi
find_segment unit reworked to use full-precision phi differences. 
That way it will find better-matching segments
fixed bug in ph_pattern unit, one of the patterns in ME3,4 was one bit 
short

47165 2016-09-23
minor rework to make timing fit
 
47174 2016-09-27
reworked DAQ to run at 80 MHz, fixed bug in ptlut address for 
two-stub tracks when phi diff was not limited to 511. DAQ untested

47214 2016-10-06
DAQ stress-tested at 80 MHz. Fixed bug that prevented sending ME records

47233 2016-10-12
fixed a small problem in AMC13 module (from BU) which used async resets. 
Made timing much easier to fit. 

47249 2016-10-13
added MPC link error reporting to DAQ

47421 2016-10-31
timing errors in BU DAQ removed by adding async_reg attributes, 
ignoring some async paths

47423 2016-11-01
fixed constraints to remove a few warnings in PAR
fixed bug found by Jia Fu, now only relevant duplicated thetas are used 

47864 2017-01-21
adding CPPF input links. Not done yet, just synthesizing now

47869 2017-01-23
implementation OK with CPPF links and debug probes on their outputs. Generated bit file

47970 2017-02-02
first attempt at RPC logic. CSC stub replacement, but not wider theta 
windows yet. Attempting synthesis now

47979 2017-02-06
RPC logic implements fine, very crudely tested in Modelsim. 
Added RPC DAQ block, implemented OK. Need to add RPC AF

48086 2017-02-15
compiles and fits timing with RPC link IDs and debug probes. Tested in HW. 
RPC AF still not implemented 

48093 2017-02-16
Added reset for cppf deframer fifo, trying to prevent unsynchronized trailers. 
Added CPPF mapping array (links to subsectors)


48096 2017-02-17
fixed bug in cppf link mapping, was starting from 1, need to start from 0

48232 2017-03-08
can see CPPF data correlated with CSC, but 7 BX later than needed by algorithm.
Correction: RPC data come 1BX before they are needed. 
Before removing FIFOs from CPPF rx deframers

48269 2017-03-15
removed FIFOs from CPPF RX deframers, needs testing

48302 2017-03-21
added RX buffer reset for CPPF links, 
changed phi conversion factor to 6991 on Jia Fu request

48431 2017-04-03
reworked RPC hit slipping logic to use all available hits
