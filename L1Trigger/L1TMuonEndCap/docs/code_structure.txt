* Main event processor is produce() in plugins/L1TMuonEndCapTrackProducer.cc
  - Produces a collection of EMTFTrack, EMTFHit, and RegionalMuonCand

  * process() in src/TrackFinder.cc creates tracks from hits (CSC LCTs and RPC segments)
    - Fills the EMTFTrack and EMTFHit collections

    * extractPrimitives() in src/SubsystemCollector.cc collects the input hits
      - Creates a collection of TriggerPrimitives from CSC and RPC digis

    * process() in src/SectorProcessor.cc runs the track-finder for each of the 12 sectors

      * process_single_bx() in src/SectorProcessor.cc runs the track-finder for each BX

      	* process() in src/PrimitiveSelection.cc processes CSC and RPC hits
	  - For CSC, creates selected_csc_map[] of LCTs by link index
	  - Configurable: includes neighbor sectors and duplicates for ambiguous strip/wire pairings


	* process() in src/PrimitiveConversion.cc converts primitives to EMTFHits
	  
	  * convert_prim_csc() converts a primitive to an EMTFHit

	    * convert_csc() computes the hit's theta, zone number(s), pattern phi, and full-precision phi

	* process() in src/PatternRecognition.cc finds 3 best "roads" (patterns)
	  - Fills pattern lifetime map and zone roads

	  - Loop over zones
	    * make_zone_image() makes a zone image from converted hits from multiple BX in each zone

	  - Loop over zones
	    * process_single_zone() creates all the "roads" (patterns) that match the hits in the zone image
	      - Loop over key phi
	      	- Loop over patterns, find road with this phi that has the highest quality
	      	  - Each road has an endcap, sector, bx, zone, key phi, pattern, straightness, layer code, and quality code
	      - Loop over created roads, cancel adjacent patterns
	      	- Road is deleted if neighbor with phi-1 has higher quality, or neighbor with phi+1 has equal or higher quality

	  - Loop over zones
	    * sort_single_zone() sorts roads and selects best three in each zone
	      - Sorting is first by key phi (high to low), then quality (high to low) when qualities are different
	      - Keep first three roads in vector, assign "winner" variable equal to index in vector (0, 1, 2)

	* process() in src/PrimitiveMatching.cc matches trigger primitives to winning roads
	  - Loop over zone-station pairings
	    * process_single_zone_station() finds the hit with the smallest dPhi to the road key phi
	  - Loop over zone-station pairings
	    - Create new track for each road, using hits with smallest dPhi in each station

	* process() in src/AngleCalculation.cc
	  - Loop over zones
	    - Loop over tracks
	      * calculate_angles()
	      	- Calculates "best" dThetas (and dPhis) between each pair of stations (out of multiple hits per station?)
	      	- Mask hit if *all* its dTheta values are larger than the theta window
	      	- Compute and fill track theta, phi, mode, rank, and pT LUT inputs
	    * erase_tracks()
	      - Erases tracks with rank = 0 from track collection	      
	      - Remove hits that did not have "best dTheta" for their station, or which failed theta window cut
	    - Loop over tracks
	      * calculate_bx() finds BX of 1st and 2nd earliest hits in tracks

	* process() in src/BestTrackSelection.cc selects best 3 tracks per sector
	  - Still coded with opaque FW notation, also does not deal with multiple BX.  (How are road / track BX assigned, anyway?)

	* process() in src/PtAssignment.cc
	  - Loop over tracks
	    * calculate_address() in src/PtAssignmentEngine.cc computes the pT LUT address
	    * calculate_pt() in src/PtAssignmentEngine.cc computes the pT from the address

### Configurable variables ###
##############################

python/simEmtfDigis_cfi.py
  * UseSecondEarliest      : Use 2nd earliest hit to time EMTF track (not yet working? - AWB 04.10.16)
  * UseSymmetricalPatterns : Use 5 symmetric patterns instead of 9 asymmetric patterns (for use starting 09.10.16)
  * FixZonePhi             : Zone phi fix from Alex (for use starting 09.10.16)

src/PrimitiveMatching.cc
  * use_fs_zone_code : Recalculate zone code (from where? why? - AWB 04.10.16)

src/BestTrackSelection.cc
  * use_fw_algo : Uses direct FW algorithm to cancel tracks (no emulator version available yet - AWB 04.10.16)

src/PtAssignment.cc
  * use_ones_complem_gmt_eta : Use one's complement notation for eta (with what effect? same or different than FW / uGMT? - AWB 04.10.16)

src/PtAssignmentEngine.cc
  * use_eta       : Use eta instead of theta in forming pT LUT address (right or wrong thing to do? - AWB 04.10.16)
  * use_FRLUT     : Use alternative calculation of FR bit (why? - AWB 04.10.16)
  * fix_dPhi9Bits : Truncated dPhi's to 512 bits (un-truncated by mistake in FW; will be fixed in FW when? - AWB 04.10.16)
  * era_4         : Include high-pT muon outlier hit fix

Others
  * Bug with modes 10 and 7 (mode_inv 5 and 14)
  * BX window
  * Other fixes mentioned by Alex and/or Jia Fu?
